# Business-Analysis---Machine-Learning-with-R

The company, Anna's World Inc., desires to increase their loyalty customers and the number of products a loyalty customer buys, because loyalty customers create more business and more profitable business for the company.
Therefore, this program is to create a machine learning regression model(s) using R in RStudio to improve the accuracy of identifying loyal customers based on purchases and time of the year. It also shows that by increasing the model to multivariate regression, you can increase the accuracy and sensitivity of the model. This can help the company promote products during specific times of the year to retain loyal customers and perhaps convert non-loyal customers to loyal customers.
